# course-tracker

This simple app allows a user to easily view and update a course list that is stored as a local text file.

Users can select a course from the drop-down menu and edit the name, grade, and credit value of a course and save it easily in their text file.

MVC design uses the Course class so that the FXML controller can interact with objects from that class.
